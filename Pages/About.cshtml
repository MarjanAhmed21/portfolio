            <div class="core-dropdown text-end">Immediately after graduating with 1st Class Honours in a Bachelor's course, I made the decision to take on the next level and face a Master's course in Computer Games Development. Through many difficult situations & obstacles forced in my way, I worked extremely hard under pressure to complete this Master's degree. Here, I further improved my skills & experience in C# programming, software development & game designing/development. Even when being forced to go abroad during semester due to an emergency, I managed to complete assignments, granted extended deadline support from my tutor, and resumed progression through the rest of the year to complete my Master's course and achieve an impressive degree of a Merit (2:1)!</div>

            <div class="core-dropdown text-end">Enrolling into the MMU to face and take on a brand new challenge, I ventured through 3 solid years in studying a Bachelor's course in Computer Games Development. This is where I developed new skills in programming with .NET, JavaScript, C#, and designing with software like Blender & Aseprite to create my own models to use in the games I developed using Unity. I gained experience of what it could be like developing applications, websites and games for companies thanks to the challenging modules I faced here. Check out the games I developed in the "Projects" page to see what I created during my time studying this course. By the end of this 3 year Bachelor's course, I graduated with a well-earned degree of 1st Class Honours!</div>

            <div class="core-dropdown text-end">Successfully enrolling into OSFC in my hometown, I studied BTEC IT Level 3 Extended Diploma as I was absolutely fascinated with technology and designing games & applications. This course introduced me to many new features and skills that define my capabilities today. I learned how to program using many languages such as C#, JavaScript, .NET, html and more. My skills in time management & communication also improved here as the abundance of workload tranformed my work ethic from slow & standard-level to now more organised and exceptional higher goals I targeted. I owe many of my talents & experiences to this 2 year course I studied, as now I am able to program and develop applications & games using the skills equiped from this studious period and imrpoved later on in university. I achieved the top grade of Triple Distinction Stars (D*D*D*)!</div>

I achieved a passing grade of a 4 in English Language, English Literature & Maths. I managed to achieve a grade 4-3 in Combined Science, and an impressive grade 5 in Art. Sadly, I underachieved with a grade 3 in ICT, a grade D in Computer Studies & a poor grade F in Product Design. This was due to a horrible situation taking place in January that year where I traveled to Bangladesh in an emergency for an entire month. My mental health was never the same for that academic year, but managing to enroll successfully to my dream college helped me move on.</div>
